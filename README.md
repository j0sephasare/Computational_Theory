## Countdown Numbers Game  By Joseph Asare

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a Python-based solution for the well-known "Countdown" television show segment, the "Countdown numbers game." In order to reach a randomly generated target number, players must use the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division within a time limit. They start with six random numbers. With an emphasis on brute force and dynamic programming techniques, this solver seeks to automate the solution process through a variety of computational tactics.

### Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

- 1. Clone the repository

    git clone

- 2. cd into the repository

- 3. pip install 

### Features 

- Brute Force Approach: Evaluates all possible combinations of numbers and operations to find an exact match to the target number.

- Dynamic Programming: Optimizes the brute force approach by reducing redundant calculations, thus improving efficiency.
